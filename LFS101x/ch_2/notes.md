## Linux Philosophy

Linux borrows heavily from the well-established UNIX operating system. It was written to be a free and open source system to be used in place of UNIX, which at the time was designed for computers much more powerful than PCs and was quite expensive. Files are stored in a hierarchical filesystem, with the top node of the system being the root or simply "/". Whenever possible, Linux makes its components available via files or objects that look like files. Processes, devices, and network sockets are all represented by file-like objects, and can often be worked with using the same utilities used for regular files. Linux is a fully multitasking (i.e. multiple threads of execution are performed simultaneously), multiuser operating system, with built-in networking and service processes known as daemons in the UNIX world.

**NOTE**: Linux was inspired by UNIX, but it is not UNIX.

## Linux Distributions

The Linux kernel is the core of the operating system. A full Linux distribution consists of the kernel plus a number of other software tools for file-related operations, user management, and software package management.

## Services Associated with Distributions

**Binary-compatible**: Binary software packages will install properly across the distributions.
