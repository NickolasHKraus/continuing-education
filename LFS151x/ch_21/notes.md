## Introduction

With cloud computing's *pay-as-you-go* and *software-defined everything* models, startups now have a very low barrier to take an enterprise assignment. And, with open source tools and ecosystems built around them, startups can innovate and adapt very fast.

Any company, be it small or big, has to innovate fast, listen to customer feedback, and then iterate over it. To do that, companies need to bring in DevOps practices and allow small teams to manage the entire lifecycle of their products, from Development to Support. Technologies like *Container as a Service*and *Continuous Integration and Deployment* allow small teams to have access of Development, QA and Deployment environments. This allows individual teams that work in an enterprise to work like startups, which is good for business.
