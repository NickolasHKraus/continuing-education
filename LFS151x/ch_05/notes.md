# Chapter 5: Containers: Micro OSes for Containers

## Tasks
- [x] None

## Introduction

The current technological trend is to run applications in containers. In this context, it makes a lot of sense to eliminate all the packages and services of the host Operating System (OS), which are not essential for running containers. With that in mind, various vendors have come forward with specialized minimal OSes to run just containers.

Once we remove the packages that are not essential to boot the base OS and to run container-related services, we are left with specialized OSes, which are referred to as **Micro OSes for containers**. Some examples of Micro OSes are:

* Alpine Linux
* Atomic Host
* Fedora CoreOS (formerly known as Red Hat CoreOS)
* RancherOS
* Ubuntu Core
* VMware Photon
